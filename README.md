# Analysis of Flight Delays & Cancellations in the US
The primary goal of the project is to analyze and recognize the factors that lead to delays and cancellations of flights in the United States. The factors that have been analysed are Seasons, months, day of the week, holidays, origin airports, reasons for cancellations/delays, regions and Airlines.

Travel websites (Skyscanner, kayak etc.) traditionally provide only the price information to their customers. Our analysis coupled with their price information can help customers make a much more informed decision while planning their travel.

This analysis can also be useful to the different Airlines & Airport Authorities to recognize the patterns and factors that lead to delays and cancellations of flights. Thereby, they can come up with solutions and thus provide better Airline performance and customer satisfaction.
